# Alexis' Software Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal portfolio of software projects! This repository gathers many of the applications, prjects, and hackathon entries I‚Äôve developed throughout my journey in computer science, and mobile development. I am a computer science  student in my sixth semester at the Tecnolog√≠co de Monterrey Campus Ciudad de M√©xico. At the moment, I have been 6 years in FIRST (3 as student and 3 as mentor), and now I am the Lead Mentor and part of the BoC (Board of Coaches) in the FIRST Robotics Competition team Nautilus 4010 and FTC team Nautilus 21735. In FIRST I have travelled to national and international competitions representing Mexico and PrepaTec. Also, I worked creating websites and maintaining them, have coordinated and leading those projects. 

## üìÅ Repository Content


- `AlgorythmsProject-2024/` ‚Äì Advanced algorithms project developed for the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course, featuring optimized implementations like Strassen‚Äôs algorithm and boolean matrix multiplication in Python.
- `Analytics-SemanaTec/` ‚Äì Machine learning and data science experiments conducted during the SemanaTec course, including clustering with K-means, data visualization, and bot detection on Twitter data during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- `AppleSwiftStudentChallenge2023/` ‚Äì Solutions and iOS apps created for the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2023, such as a color recognition tool for colorblind users using RGB distance algorithms.
- `DungeonsandDragons-Game/` ‚Äì A Dungeons & Dragons-inspired game built in Unity for the "Fundamentals of Programming" course, using data structures like hash tables and linked lists for player stats, inventory, and game logic.
- `HackMX6-2024-iOSApp/` ‚Äì iOS app developed during HackMX6, sponsored by Liverpool. The app, with the camera and AI tools using a custom Gemini API, identifies the closest or closests products in the Liverpool inventory. 
- `MAS-2024/` ‚Äì Multi Agents System that simulates a city with semaphores and different types of vehicules and pedestrians. Was used MESA and Unity.
- `Racket-2024/` ‚Äì Syntax analyzer for Python files built in Racket using BNF, lexical automata, and parallel programming, highlighting over 140 lexical categories in color-coded HTML outputs.
- `SkilliketiOSApp-2024/` ‚Äì Career-oriented iOS app built for the Skiliket competition, featuring project creation, file upload, profile building, and a conection with a Cisco Packet Tracer Project to monitor the network and sensors implemented on it.
- `UnityMathGame-2024/` ‚Äì Educational math game developed in Unity targeting primary school children, paired with a web-based statistics dashboard to track learning progress via a backend server.
- `iOSHack-2023/` ‚Äì Navigation-focused iOS app developed for the UP iOS Hackathon 2023, designed to guide users through indoor environments with custom map-building tools and interactive UI elements.
